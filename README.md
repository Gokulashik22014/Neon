# Welcome to Neon 
## An online app for posting AI-generated images and videos

With the rising trend in AI and capabilities of generating from text to videos, it is fascinating to see what a single line of prompt can do. However, different people write different styles of prompts, so I have created Neon, an app where users can post images and videos generated by AI along with the prompt they used to generate it. The app is built using React Native Expo.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Install Expo and Set Up Expo in Your System

### Step 2: Run 
```bash
npm install
```
   # Steps to Setup Appwrite

## Step 3: Create an Account on [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)

1. Visit [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/).
2. Create an account.

## Step 4: Create a Configuration File

Create a file `config.ts` under `lib/config.ts` and add the following:

```typescript
export const config = {
  endpoint: "Your Endpoint",
  platform: "com.client.neon",
  projectId: "Your ProjectID",
  databaseId: "Your DatabaseID",
  usersId: "Your UserCollectionID",
  videosId: "Your VideosCollectionID",
  storageId: "Your StorageID",
};
```
## Step 5: To get the above ID create the service in appwrite

   ### 1 Create an accoutn
   ### 2 Create a project copy the projectID
   ### 3 Create a Database copy the DatabaseID
   ### 4 Create a Storage copy the StorageID
   ### 5 In database create two collections namely `users` and `videos` and copy their ID's
